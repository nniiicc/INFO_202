### Theories and Perspectives II


1. What is the character? "texture"? 
2. What goes right and what goes wrong? 
3. Who benefits?

For each of these we ask - How, and Why? 

### Big Ideas

1. Theories are contingent predictive models
2. Symbolic interactionism
3.  -- 


What is a theory? 

- Specifies a context [ whats in and whats out ] 
- creates a frame for interpretation [ what do things mean (i.e. check," "meeting") ] 
- Models prediction and causality [ given current situation, whats going to happen ] 

A theory is " a contingent predictive model"
 
- set of if/then statements
 
``What makes a good theory? - Theories are like maps - the value of a theory or a map is judged by whether or not they help us get where we want to go.`` 
 
Scientiific theory: 

- systematically conforms to systematic data
    - ... is generated from data
    - ... measured against data

Five theoretical perspectives informing this class:

1. Symbolic interactionism
2. Functionalism
3. STINS 
4. Information Societies / Political Economy
5. Media Theory

Symbolic Interactionism

Converting the world to symbols that have meaning

Blummers' tenents: 

1. Human beings act towards "things" on the basis of meanings that the things have for them. ( They take action based on the interpretation they have) ``This is the main idea of SI - not just events and and actions - but what happens in the middle``
2. The meaning of things arises and accumulates via social interaction (encounters, negotiations, histories). 
3. Meanings are negotiated and interpreted by human beings in specific situations. 
 
- Reified reality - (symbology   

Meanings and Objects

- Meanings change in different social contexts 

The definitions of the situation... 

- What is the situation - form ones that we know and understand
- if a new type of situation, how dose make sense of whats happening
- what are important objects and events, and what can be neglected or assumed away?
- what interpret ions do we give to these objects and events
- Hod do we act towards them in this (class of) situation(s)?

How do we answer big three questions with SI? (i.e. ICTs, Social Arrangmenets, and SI)
