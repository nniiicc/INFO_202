Parser opens by (largely) making this argument: “The algorithms that orchestrate our ads are starting to orchestrate our lives.”


Writing of the power of Internet filters :

“They are prediction engines, constantly creating and refining a theory of who you are and what you’ll do and want next. ”

The unique universe of information that these filters create is what Parser calls the "filter bubble"
 
Why is this different then previous periods where we consume media that we "like" ? 

 He argues that the filter bubble introduces three dynamics we have never dealt with before: 

 1. You're alone in the filter. 
 
 2. The filter bubble is invisilbe ( we don't know what decisions are being made on are behalf ... its impossible to understand the bias that are attached or calculated on our behalf)
 
 3. Entering the bubble isn't a choice - we choose what tv to watch, we dont choose what restrictions are placed on our search results. 

Parser argues that filters harm us in ways that are analogous to taste in the natural world - if we are attracted to sugars and fats... and that is all we consume, we will become sedentary, obese creatures. 

Similarly, our information diet is affected by our taste - our interests naturally gravitate towards the salacious, the violent, sexual or gossip... if we have filters that *only* show us this content, we similarly become intellecutally obese. 

"“ a world constructed from the familiar is a world in which there’s nothing to learn. If personalization is too acute, it could prevent us from coming into contact with the mind-blowing, preconception-shattering experiences and ideas that change how we think about the world and ourselve.”

“Personalization is based on a bargain. In exchange for the service of filtering, you hand large companies an enormous amount of data about your daily life—much of which you might not trust friends with. ”

Bonding and Bridging in social capital

Bonding is the type of social capital that is personal, and developed with the interactions that are forged in classroom or workplace settings

Bridging is the type of social capital which happens with loose ties - such as a town hall - or a university library - there is a connection, but it is loose and informal. 

Bridging capital is valuable - it holds ability to pay off with the strength of weak ties.
