>Given enough apps - all of humanity's bugs are shallow. 

Get rich by saving the world.. it is not enough to disrupt technology, there is a need for silicon valley to save humanity. 

Bowling alone - to blogging together... social capital has transfered from a f2fIRL phenomena, to online forumn... is it the same thing?

"I find much of this future terryfing, but not for the reasons you would expect." Silicon Valley will have the means to accomplish some of its craziest plans. "we also need to question the adequacy of the innovator's ends."

EM will question both the means and the ends of SV to lates quest to "solve problems" ....Silicon Valley's promise of eternal amelioration has blunted our ability to do this questioning. 

"This book attempts to factor in the true costs of this highly awaited paradise and to explain why they have been so hard to account for."

Imperfection, ambiguity, opacity, disorder, and the opportunity to err, to sin, to do the wrong thing; all of these are constitutive of human freedom, and any concentrated attempt to root them out will root out that freedom as well. 

Sometimes imperfect is good enough; sometimes it's muhc better than perfect. 

**Solutionism** + **Internet-centrism**

## Ch 1 Solutionism 

Morozov contends that part of what makes us controllable, what gives SV the vision for shaping behavior is that certain platforms, like facebook, are ubiquitous - the power, as he puts it, is in standardization. 

Passive activism - as he puts it, just carrying your phone can be an act of good citizenship ... think of the same token by which you probably pirate files... just leaving your comp on allows you to "seed", right?

the ideology that legitmizaes and and sanctions actions to "imrpove" is solutionism. 

EM contends that vices are often virtues in disguise. 

Hirchsman, all reforms attract conservative criticism that build on one of the following three themes: 
1. Perversity : whereby the proposed intervention only worsens the problem at hand)
2. Futility : invention yields no results
3. Jeopardy : intervention threatens to undermine some previous hard-earned accomplishment. 


"The physical infrastrcture we know as the internet bears very little resemblance to the mythical internet that lies at the center of our public debates." p. 14

The internet enables many of the grandest visions of solutionism, and so this gives rise to "Internet Centrism" - a firm conviction that we are lving through unique and revolutaiotn times in which previous truths no longer hold, and the need to fix things runs as high as ever. 

the war being wages is on "inefficiency, ambiguity, and disorder"
